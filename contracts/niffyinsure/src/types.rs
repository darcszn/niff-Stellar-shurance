// GOVERNANCE NOTE: This constant is the only on-chain parameter controlling

// cannot be altered by the admin at runtime — removing an avenue for
// admin-only extraction via strike-count manipulation.
//
// LEGAL NOTE: Product/legal must sign off on the strike threshold before
// mainnet deployment. Three rejections is a conservative starting point.
// The threshold intentionally errs toward coverage preservation; false
// positives (legitimate holders de-activated) are harder to recover from
// than false negatives (fraudulent holders retained until human review).
//
// APPEAL INTERACTION: If an appeal window is added later, auto-deactivation
// should be deferred until the appeal deadline passes. Implement by adding a
// `deactivation_pending_until_ledger: u32` field to Policy and skipping the
// `is_active = false` write until that ledger is reached.
