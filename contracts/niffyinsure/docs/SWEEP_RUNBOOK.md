# Emergency Token Sweep Runbook

## Overview

The emergency token sweep function (`sweep_token`) allows authorized administrators to recover tokens that were mistakenly sent to the NiffyInsure contract. This document provides operational guidance, legal requirements, and ethical constraints for using this high-risk function.

## ⚠️ Critical Warning

**This function must NEVER be used to:**
- Confiscate user entitlements or premium payments
- Avoid paying approved claims
- Seize funds that belong to policyholders
- Circumvent normal protocol operations

Misuse of this function will result in:
- Irreparable reputational damage
- Potential legal liability
- Loss of user trust
- Regulatory scrutiny

## When Sweep is Permissible

### Legitimate Use Cases (Reason Codes)

| Code | Scenario | Example | Risk Level |
|------|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Accidental user transfer | User sends tokens to contract address instead of their wallet | Low |
| 2 | Test tokens on mainnet | Test tokens accidentally sent to production contract | Low |
| 3 | Unsolicited airdrops | Third-party airdrop tokens not part of protocol | Low |
| 4 | Deprecated asset migration | Moving funds from deprecated token to new version | Medium |
| 5-99 | Reserved | Future protocol-defined scenarios | TBD |
| 100+ | Custom organizational | Organization-specific codes (document internally) | Varies |

### When Sweep is NOT Permissible

❌ **Never sweep when:**
- Tokens represent user premium payments
- Tokens are needed for approved claim payouts
- Tokens are part of protocol treasury reserves
- Origin of tokens is unclear or disputed
- Legal ownership is contested
- Regulatory investigation is ongoing

## Pre-Sweep Checklist

Before executing a sweep operation, complete ALL of the following:

### 1. Investigation Phase

- [ ] Identify the source of the tokens (blockchain explorer, transaction hash)
- [ ] Verify tokens are NOT user premiums or claim funds
- [ ] Check if tokens are part of an airdrop or promotional campaign
- [ ] Review recent contract transactions for context
- [ ] Document findings in incident report

### 2. Authorization Phase

- [ ] Obtain approval from at least 3 authorized signers (multisig)
- [ ] Document business justification with reason code
- [ ] Verify no open claims would be affected
- [ ] Confirm sufficient reserves remain after sweep
- [ ] Legal/compliance review completed (if required by policy)

### 3. Technical Validation

- [ ] Verify asset is allowlisted
- [ ] Check current sweep cap (if configured)
- [ ] Calculate protected balance (approved claims)
- [ ] Confirm sweep amount leaves adequate reserves
- [ ] Test sweep on testnet with similar conditions (if time permits)

### 4. Communication Phase

- [ ] Notify relevant stakeholders (if material amount)
- [ ] Prepare public transparency statement (if required)
- [ ] Update internal audit log
- [ ] Schedule post-sweep verification

## Execution Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Information

```bash
# Get contract balance for asset
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  get_balance \
  --asset <ASSET_ADDRESS>

# Check protected balance (approved claims)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  get_claim_counter

# Review each claim status
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  get_claim \
  --claim_id <CLAIM_ID>
```

### Step 2: Calculate Safe Sweep Amount

```
Safe Sweep Amount = Current Balance - Protected Balance - Safety Buffer

Where:
- Current Balance: Total tokens in contract
- Protected Balance: Sum of all approved (unpaid) claims
- Safety Buffer: 10-20% reserve for operational needs (recommended)
```

**Example:**
```
Current Balance:    1,000,000 tokens
Approved Claims:      600,000 tokens
Safety Buffer (15%):  150,000 tokens
─────────────────────────────────────
Safe Sweep Amount:    250,000 tokens
```

### Step 3: Configure Sweep Cap (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Set per-transaction cap (e.g., 100,000 tokens)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_MULTISIG> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  set_sweep_cap \
  --cap 100000000000  # Amount in stroops (7 decimals)
```

### Step 4: Execute Sweep

```bash
# Execute sweep with multisig authorization
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_MULTISIG> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  sweep_token \
  --asset <ASSET_ADDRESS> \
  --recipient <DESTINATION_ADDRESS> \
  --amount <AMOUNT_IN_STROOPS> \
  --reason_code <CODE>
```

### Step 5: Verify and Document

```bash
# Verify sweep completed
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- \
  get_balance \
  --asset <ASSET_ADDRESS>

# Check event emission
stellar events \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network mainnet \
  --filter "emergency_sweep"
```

## Post-Sweep Actions

### Immediate (Within 1 hour)

1. Verify destination received tokens
2. Update internal audit log with:
   - Transaction hash
   - Amount swept
   - Reason code
   - Approving signers
   - Timestamp
3. Confirm remaining balance covers all obligations

### Short-term (Within 24 hours)

1. Review event logs for anomalies
2. Notify finance/accounting team
3. Update treasury reconciliation
4. File incident report (if required)

### Long-term (Within 1 week)

1. Conduct post-mortem if sweep was due to operational error
2. Update procedures to prevent recurrence
3. Review and adjust sweep cap if needed
4. Compliance review (if material amount)

## Protected Balance Calculation

The contract automatically calculates protected balance as:

```rust
protected_balance = sum(approved_claims.amount) where claim.status == Approved
```

### What is Protected

✅ **Protected (cannot sweep):**
- Approved claims awaiting payout
- Claims in "Approved" status

### What is NOT Protected

⚠️ **Not automatically protected (requires manual judgment):**
- Premium reserves (operational float)
- Claims in "Processing" status (not yet approved)
- Future claim obligations (not yet filed)
- Protocol treasury reserves

**Operators MUST maintain adequate reserves beyond the protected balance to ensure protocol solvency.**

## Residual Risk Disclosure

### Limitations of Protected Balance Check

The contract **cannot perfectly distinguish** between:
- Legitimate premium reserves
- Stray tokens (accidental transfers)
- Operational float needed for day-to-day operations

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Safety Buffer**: Always leave 10-20% buffer above protected balance
2. **Treasury Monitoring**: Track premium inflows vs. claim outflows
3. **Regular Audits**: Monthly reconciliation of expected vs. actual reserves
4. **Conservative Sweeps**: When in doubt, sweep less rather than more

### Example Risk Scenario

```
Scenario: Contract holds 1M tokens
- Approved claims: 400K (protected)
- Recent premiums: 300K (not distinguishable)
- Stray airdrop: 300K (target for sweep)

Risk: Sweeping 300K might inadvertently take premium reserves
Mitigation: Sweep only 200K, leaving 100K buffer
```

## Multisig Requirements

### Production Mainnet

**REQUIRED:** 3-of-5 multisig or stronger

- Minimum 3 signers required for sweep execution
- Signers should be from different organizational roles:
  - Technical lead
  - Finance/treasury
  - Legal/compliance
  - Operations
  - Executive sponsor

### Testnet

**RECOMMENDED:** 2-of-3 multisig

- Allows testing of multisig workflows
- Reduces operational friction for testing

### Multisig Setup (Stellar)

```bash
# Create multisig account
stellar keys generate multisig-admin

# Configure signers and thresholds
stellar account set-options \
  --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
  --signer <SIGNER_1_PUBLIC_KEY>:1 \
  --signer <SIGNER_2_PUBLIC_KEY>:1 \
  --signer <SIGNER_3_PUBLIC_KEY>:1 \
  --signer <SIGNER_4_PUBLIC_KEY>:1 \
  --signer <SIGNER_5_PUBLIC_KEY>:1 \
  --low-threshold 3 \
  --med-threshold 3 \
  --high-threshold 3
```

## Legal & Compliance Requirements

### Before Mainnet Enablement
